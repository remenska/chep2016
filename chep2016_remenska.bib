@article{1742-6596-513-5-052033,
	abstract = "CHEP Conferences are dedicated to a quite specific scientific computing domain, and deal with rather specialised software, developed for the needs of the High Energy Physics community. The sheer size of this community created an environment which until recently has been to a large extent isolated from the mainstream computing. There is however an emerging trend for the computing solutions to spill outside the traditional laboratory boundaries, benefiting from becoming less domain-specific. This paper summarises the panel discussion held at the CHEP'13 conference with the goal to answer the questions, why the mainstream software approaches are not always suitable for the High Energy Physics community, and why its own solutions so far enjoyed little popularity in other domains?",

	abstract = "The increases of data size and in the geographical distribution of analysis intensify the demand on the I/O subsystem. Over the last year, we greatly improved the I/O throughput, in some case by several factors, when reading ROOT files. ROOT'S improved techniques include improving the pre-existing prefetching, the automatic flushing of data buffers at regular intervals and streaming objects member-wise. These advances reduce the number of transactions with the local disk or the network. We worked in close collaboration with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments to optimize the I/O access to their use cases and to help adapt their framework to take full advantage of these advances. This presentation will describe in details these improvements and how users can benefit from them.",
